                    <p>The Biden Administration is continuing towards its goal for 56% of new vehicles to be electric by 2032.

                <p></br>According to the U.S. Department of Energy, taxpayers can receive a <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/laws/ELEC?state=US">tax credit up to $7,500</a>. There are certain restrictions for new and used cars as well the purchase year. If those are not met, owners can also apply to get the $3,750 tax credit for the mineral compenent, instead of the battery. Although this isn't all an EV owner can get. Wes Stewart, the Clean Transportation for All Organizer, said there are a couple thousand dollars that can come from counties too.</p>

                  <p><br/>Particularly, in the Washington, purchases of electric and hybrid cars continue daily. As of April 19, 2024 there are over 180,000 cars registered that fall into this category. Tesla is the leading car brand as all their vehicles are electric and have become more popularized on the West Coast. They currently sell the Model S, Model 3, Model Y, and Model X. Its newest model is the Cybertruck. Other car brands are taking note as they are rolling out with new series or models of fully electric or hybrid cars. Nissan comes in second as they have their sedan make, Nissan LEAF, and SUV make, Nissan ARIYA. Other brands like Chevrolet, Ford and BMW trail behind in Washington with the drop-off of over 5,000 vehicles. </p>

                  <p>Also, electric vehicle chargers are becoming more prevalent throughout the US. They are most common to find closer to the city and even in shopping plazas or malls. Some are free and some are not, which may be beatable as opposed to having to fill a tank with gas. The output there comes to owning a charger at home and having it impact the electricity bill. The Washington Chapter of the Sierra Club is working on charging infrastructure on the policy level, as the need for accessibility increase.</p></br>

                  <p>"There's been some efforts to coordinate with utility companies and with larger developers to allow renters to have access," Stewart said. "Whether that's in a bigger apartment complex - like an underground parking garage. Or adding to a duplex or house allowing landlords to install direct EV charging infrastructure."</p>

                <p></br>As shown, ownership is typically concentrated on the Western side of Washington, or closer to capital Seattle. This is in turn coincides with where most EV chargers are placed publicly across the country. The US DOE has a <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity-locations#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC"> map</a> on their website to find the closest EV station for anyone to use.</p> </br>

                    <p>Though work is being done at the federal level, more so with the charging station grants, states are taking other matters into their own hands. One example is providing incentives, on top of the government rebate, for car buyers. The Clean <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/all?state=WA">Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibilty</a> in Washington, is defined as new or used vehicles that are "exempt from the state retail sales and use tax." However, these cars must stay under $45,000 when purchased new, and under $30,000 when purchased used. Each state has their own threshold limit. More owners in Washington appear to choose battery electric vehicles over plug-in hybrids because their ranges are typically under 100 miles, with the exception that the BMW I3 exceeds that range.</p>

                <p></br>Despite the closing gap for the Biden Administration to achieve its goal in 2032 and for the Paris Agreement to be fulfilled with net-zero emissions in 2050, it's uncertain how possible this in reality. Some of the concerns are those of equity. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm">
                <p></br>"The picture looks like that a lot of low income folks, a lot of communities of color, a lot of people with mobility issues, multi-generational households, immigrant communities are often on the fringes of cities and suburban or ex-suburban are locked into car dependency," Stewart said.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm">
                <p></br>The transition to electric vehicles might be easier for some, but not so attainable for other. With grants and programs, there is some work that can be done yet underrepresented groups have to look for alternative ways to help. For them, personal vehicles may be the main mode of transportation especially if they live far away and do not have charging stations nearby. According to Find My Electric, the <a href=https://www.findmyelectric.com/blog/electric-car-prices/#:~:text=The%20average%20price%20of%20the,end%20trim%20of%20each%20model.>median price</a> for an EV still sits around $50,000.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm">
                <p></br>However, people can turn to their state and local leaders for help as not all hope is lost. Like the "rulemaking" work the Washington Chapter does, there are dozens of organization in each state that can make sustainable actions. Instead of switching to an entirely new vehicle, allowing for states to make their public fleet vehicles have cleaner fuel, can make a domino-effect difference.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm">
                <p></br> "States can in fact can handle a total transition of those vehicles," Stewart said. "It can accelerate the development of EV technology. It can invite the EV companies to create better vehicles, more affordable vehicles, a diversity of models of cars - sedans, SUVs, trucks etcera that in theory, based on market economics, should lower the cost of vehicles."</p>
